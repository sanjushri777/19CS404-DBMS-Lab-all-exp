# Experiment 6: Joins

## AIM
To study and implement different types of joins.

## THEORY

SQL Joins are used to combine records from two or more tables based on a related column.

### 1. INNER JOIN
Returns records with matching values in both tables.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

### 2. LEFT JOIN
Returns all records from the left table, and matched records from the right.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```
### 3. RIGHT JOIN
Returns all records from the right table, and matched records from the left.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```
### 4. FULL OUTER JOIN
Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

**Question 1**
--
Write the SQL query that achieves the selection of the "nurse_id" from the "nurses" table (aliased as "n") and the "department_name" from the "departments" table, with an inner join on the "department_id" column and conditions filtering for a nurse with the first name 'David' and last name 'Moore'.

NURSES TABLE:

ATTRIBUTES - nurse_id, first_name, last_name, department_id

DEPARTMENTS TABLE:

ATTRIBUTES - department_id, department_name
```sql
SELECT 
    n.nurse_id, 
    d.department_name
FROM 
    nurses n
INNER JOIN 
    departments d 
ON 
    n.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE 
    n.first_name = 'David' 
    AND n.last_name = 'Moore';

```

**Question 2**
---
Write the SQL query that achieves the selection of the "cust_name" column from the "customer" table (aliased as "c"), and the "ord_no," "ord_date," and "purch_amt" columns from the "orders" table (aliased as "o"), with a left join on the "customer_id" column.

'customer' Table: (customer_id, cust_name, city, grade, salesman_id)

'orders' Table: (ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id, salesman_id)
```sql
SELECT 
    c.cust_name, 
    o.ord_no, 
    o.ord_date, 
    o.purch_amt
FROM 
    customer c
LEFT JOIN 
    orders o 
ON 
    c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

**Output:**

    c.cust_name AS "Customer Name", 
    c.grade, 
    s.name AS "Salesman", 
    s.commission

    salesman s 
    ON o.salesman_id = s.salesman_id;

```

From the following tables write a SQL query to locate those salespeople who do not live in the same city where their customers live and have received a commission of more than 12% from the company. Return Customer Name, customer city, Salesman, salesman city, commission.  

Sample table: customer

```sql
SELECT 
    c.cust_name AS "Customer Name",
    c.city AS "city",
    s.name AS "Salesman",
    s.city AS "city",
    s.commission
FROM 
    customer c
JOIN 
    salesman s
ON 
    c.salesman_id = s.salesman_id
WHERE 
    c.city <> s.city
    AND s.commission > 0.12;

```
